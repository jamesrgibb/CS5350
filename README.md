# CS5350

This is a machine learning library developed by James Gibb for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

Decision Tree: folder contains all the code, data, and resources related to building and evaluating decision tree models using the ID3 algorithm.
  
Ensemble Learning: contains various ensemble methods like Random Forests, AdaBoost aiming to improve the model performance.

Linear Regression: contains methods implmementing stochastic gradient descent, and batch gradient descent. 

Perceptron: This code implements and compares three versions of the perceptron algorithm: standard, voted, and average. Then calculates the average test error for each variation.
